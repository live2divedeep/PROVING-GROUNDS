# PROVING-GROUNDS
Location based DRAG-RACING(BRACKET) game w/ XRPL blockchain integration for SCOREBOARD/WAGERING.
We aim to use precise GPS location DEVICEs to MONITER competitiors(USERS) "DISTANCE TRAVELED." This INformation will Facilitate our VIRTUAL RACE EVENT while the XRPL blockcahin will provide scoreboard and wagering capabilities.
Anyone who participates in motorsports RACING activities will now be able to RACE opponents, regardless of GEOGRAPHICAL location.
XRPL blockchain will bring ENCRYPTION elements to proprietary USER DATA, while providing accurate RECORDING of scoreboard(winners/loosers) and WAGER TRANSACTIONs.
Proving GROUNDS will provide RACING ENTHUSIESTS and SPECTATORS a NEW PLACE TO COMPETE/SUPPORT other users in an ENTERTAINING and COMPETITIVE way.
Most importantly PROVING GOUNDS allows those who lack local events(racetracks) in their respective locations a chance to do what they love, AND participate in our VIRTUAL EVENTs!
We will attract COMPETITORS from LOACAL RACING EVENTs around the WORLD, as Blockchain Technology brings them TOGETHER into ONE WORLDWIDE RACING LEAGUE called PROVING GROUNDS.
