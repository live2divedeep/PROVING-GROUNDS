# PROVING-GROUNDS
Location based DRAG-RACING game w/ XRPL integration for SCOREBOARD/WAGERING
We aim to use precise GPS location DEVICEs to MONITER competitiors(USERS) "DISTANCE TRAVELED." This INformation will Facilitate our VIRTUAL RACE EVENT scoreboard and wagering PLATFORM
Anyone who participates in motorsports RACING activities will now be able to RACE opponents, of the same CATAGORY, regardless of GEOGRAPHICAL location.
XRPL blockchain will bring ENCRYPTION elements to proprietary USER DATA, while providing accurate MAINTAINING/RECORDING of scoreboard(winners/loosers) and WAGER TRANSACTIONs.
Proving GROUNDS will provide RACING ENTHUSIESTS and SPECTATORS a NEW PLACE TO COMPETE/SUPPORT other users in an ENTERTAINING and COMPETITIVE way.
Most importantly PROVING GOUNDS allows those who lack local events(racetracks) in their respective locations a chance to do what they love, AND participate our VIRTUAL EVENTs!
We will attract COMPETITORS from LOACAL RACING EVENTs around the WORLD, as Blockchain Technology brings them TOGETHER into ONE WORLDWIDE RACING LEAGUE call PROVING GROUNDS.
